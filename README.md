DevOps Engineer
Welcome to my GitHub repository! I am a DevOps Engineer with expertise in Docker, Kubernetes, and Node.js backend development. This repository contains projects and code snippets related to these areas, showcasing my skills and experience in the field.

Course
I recently completed the [TutsNode.com] Docker and Kubernetes course, which has enhanced my knowledge and understanding of containerization, orchestration, and deploying applications at scale. The course provided me with practical insights into building, managing, and scaling Docker containers, as well as deploying and managing applications using Kubernetes.

Repository Contents
This repository is organized as follows:

Docker: This directory contains Dockerfiles and related configuration files for various projects. These files demonstrate my ability to containerize applications and create efficient Docker images.

Kubernetes: Here, you will find YAML files and deployment configurations for deploying applications on Kubernetes clusters. These files highlight my proficiency in managing and orchestrating containers using Kubernetes.

Node.js: This section includes Node.js projects and code snippets that showcase my backend development skills. You can explore the code to get an idea of my expertise in building robust and scalable server-side applications using Node.js.

Feel free to explore the different directories, review the code, and provide any feedback or suggestions you may have. I am always open to collaborating and improving my skills.
